# Problem 1:

- The local commuter railroad operates between several cities in India, with each route being one-way due to budget constraints. This means that a route from Delhi to Chennai does not automatically imply a return route from Chennai to Delhi. In fact, even if both routes do exist, they could be distinct and have different distances.
